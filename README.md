# FlinkFood

## Overview

FlinkFood is a project that addresses the challenge of providing users with informed decisions about restaurant choices, customized recommendations, and real-time delivery management. The project aims to implement a Data Fabric solution using Apache FlinkÂ®.

## Motivation

Every day, users place orders on FlinkFood, each with unique preferences and requirements. Restaurants continually update their menus, creating a need for an efficient data aggregation system. FlinkFood is designed to meet this need by implementing a Data Fabric solution with Apache Flink.

## Code Style
The decided on coding style in this project is the Google Java Style Guide.

## Features
The FlinkFood application takes inputs from 18 different database tables. Uses CDC through debezium to capture changes in these tables and then creates a single view for the customer, restaurant and dishes. This single view is then stored in a MongoDB collection. The main point of this project is to test out the Apache Flink engine for the MIA Platform team and to assess risks and advantages with using the Apache Flink engine for data stream processing
