# FlinkFood

## Overview

FlinkFood is a project that addresses the challenge of providing users with informed decisions about restaurant choices, customized recommendations, and real-time delivery management. The project aims to implement a Data Fabric solution using Apache FlinkÂ®.

## Motivation

Every day, users place orders on FlinkFood, each with unique preferences and requirements. Restaurants continually update their menus, creating a need for an efficient data aggregation system. FlinkFood is designed to meet this need by implementing a Data Fabric solution with Apache Flink.

## Code Style
The decided code style is the Google Java Style Guide. This is enforced by the Intellij IDEA.

## Main features
These are the main features of the FlinkFood application:
- System of records implemented using PostgreSQL populated with mock data.
- Change data capture (CDC) in Debezium. Capturing changes in system of records and sending them through Kafka.
- Aggregation of several tables into 3 distinct single views in MongoDB
    - Aggregation of lists. I.e. a restaurant is connected to several reviews. This is reflected in the single view of restaurant
- Fully containerized using docker compose.
- Support for the [Apache Flink Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managed-flink/latest/java/how-dashboard.html)
- Support for Grafana dashboards showing [Apache Flink Metrics](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/ops/metrics/)

2. Make changes, re-run the docker containers to test and commit (`git commit -m 'simple_commit_message'`, eg: `git commit -m 'update_README.md'`). In case you have done the work along-side someone (Parallel computing), you can commit with them as co-authors (how to do it: [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors))
3. Push to the branch (`git push origin 'name_of_created_branch'`)
4. Create a pull request into the develop branch (details below). Make sure to add the reviewers of the work as the co-collaborators assigned on the Ja board.
5. Then the pull request should be squashed merged to include all the commits in the merge commit.

Please follow the [Git flow workflow](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow) and adhere to the established code style.
