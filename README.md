# FlinkFood

## Overview

FlinkFood is a project that addresses the challenge of providing users with informed decisions about restaurant choices, customized recommendations, and real-time delivery management. The project aims to implement a Data Fabric solution using Apache FlinkÂ®.

## Motivation

Every day, users place orders on FlinkFood, each with unique preferences and requirements. Restaurants continually update their menus, creating a need for an efficient data aggregation system. FlinkFood is designed to meet this need by implementing a Data Fabric solution with Apache Flink.

## Tests

Comprehensive tests are yet to be defined for the project. Test examples and guidelines will be added in future updates.

## How to Use

To use FlinkFood, follow these steps:

### How to run

See the [documentation for how to run FlinkFood](docs/howToRun.md) for more details on these steps.

### Basic docker commands

Using the following commands will start docker containers for Kafka and Apache Flink. Flink is running in session mode. This means that we have a long-running Flink Cluster which we can submit jobs to. This is preferably done in the web UI (see below). For more information on this configuration of Apache Flink, see: [Apache Flink Documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/deployment/resource-providers/standalone/docker/#session-mode-1)

1. Launch a cluster in the foreground (use -d for background)

```sh
docker-compose up
```

2. Access Web UI
   When the cluster is running, you can visit the web UI at http://localhost:8081.

3. Kill the cluster

```sh
docker-compose down
```

### Interacting with the different containers

#### PostgreSQL container

Run the following command to enter the PostgreSQL container:

```sh
docker exec -it flinkfood-postgres-1 sh
```

To enter the postgreSQL database by running this command:

```sh
psql -U postgresuser -d shipment_db
```

Now you can run SQL commands :)

### Optional configuration

- Scale the cluster up or down to N TaskManagers

```sh
docker-compose scale taskmanager=<N>
```

- Access the JobManager container

```sh
docker exec -it $(docker ps --filter name=jobmanager --format={{.ID}}) /bin/sh
```
